This page is a summary of what's going on in my life currently (inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com)).

Writing the [packagemain.tech](https://packagemain.tech) Newsletter about Backend, Go, Cloud, Kubernetes and more.

Occasionally when I have time and energy I do videos for [@packagemain](https://youtube.com/@packagemain) YouTube channel.

**Professionally**, I recently joined [BINARLY](https://binarly.io) as a Staff Software Engineer to help the world move toward less legacy code, a simplified and more secure supply chain.

**Personally**, I live in Berlin, playing table tennis in a very small not famous [Die Pinguine](http://www.ttc-pinguine.de/) team. We have tournaments now.

Last year I started running on a regular basis and completed my first half marathon with a time 2:04. Now running is my main sport activity, trying to run at least twice a week.
