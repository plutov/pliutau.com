This page is a summary of what's going on in my life currently (inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com)).

Writing the [packagemain.tech](https://packagemain.tech) Newsletter about Backend, Go, Cloud, Kubernetes and more.

**Professionally**, I'm leading an engineering team at [Solsten](https://solsten.io), deeply involved in Cloud, Infrastructure, Backend and general product dev. FYI: I joined Solsten in 2019 as first engineer. We're hiring now btw.

**Personally**, I live in Berlin, playing table tennis in very small not not famous [Die Pinguine](http://www.ttc-pinguine.de/) team. We have tournaments now.

Last year I started running on a regular basis and completed my first half marathon with a time 2:04. Now running is my main sport activity, trying to run at least twice a week.
