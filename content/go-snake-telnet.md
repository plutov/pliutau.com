Telnet games were very popular some time ago, especially this Star Wars movie: `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl`.

I wanted to create something in Go, and I wrote this [Snake game over Telnet](https://github.com/plutov/go-snake-telnet).

Go is awesome in this case, no need any dependencies to build this funny stuff.
