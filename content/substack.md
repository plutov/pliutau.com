Today me and my friend/colleague Julien Singler are starting a new Substack Newsletter called "package main" (this name may sound familiar).

It's one-stop shop for mastering Backend, Cloud, DevOps, APIs, etc. We'll provide you with hands-on, practical and real-world tutorials that you can use to build your software development skills.
